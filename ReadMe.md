A little program that take your webcam stream, convert it into ASCII and display it in your browser.

To install the dependencies run :
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run it, run :
`python3 main.py [options]`

The options are :

`--size x` : display at a factor x of the size of your terminal

`--color` : display colorized ASCII characters (:warning: Can glitch because a lot of non printable characters)
